# YelpExercise

A short data science exercise on the [Yelp Academic Dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge/dataset)
using [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) and [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/).

This project consists of 2 parts:
+ ProcessTarFile.py: A script, parsing the tarred Yelp dataset, and exporting the data to 5 tabular CSV files.
+ YelpAnalysis.ipynb: A Jupyter notebook, reading the CSV files, performing some exploratory data analysis on joined tables of the input dataset (using pandas), and testing some predictive analysis (using scikit-learn).

### Usage
The code can be executed in containerized form. Assuming a working [docker](https://www.docker.com/) installation, proceed as follows:
